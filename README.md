# API TITAN 

API TITAN is a full-stack platform built during the **Overclock Hackathon** that helps developers
**create mock APIs, test them, and simulate CI/CD workflows** — all from a single dashboard.

This project focuses on making backend development and API testing faster, easier, and more visual.

## Key Features

### Mock API Builder
- Create REST APIs instantly without writing backend code
- Define endpoints, methods, and JSON responses
- Test APIs live using a built-in API playground (Mini Postman)

### Test Suites
- Group multiple API tests into test suites
- Run test suites manually or via simulated CI triggers
- Store test results and statuses in the database

### CI Integration (Simulated)
- Simulated CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
- Webhook-based triggers to run tests automatically
- Visual status tracking for pipelines

### Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time metrics for APIs, test suites, and success rate
- Recent activity feed
- Quick actions for common workflows
